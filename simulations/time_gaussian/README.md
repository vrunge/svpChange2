# Gaussian runtime study

`run_time.R` compares PELT and the three Gaussian SVP modes calibrated to the
same null false-positive probability:

- PELT / none / penalty = 2 log(n)
- SVP Gaussian / none / c = 0.968
- SVP Gaussian / right / c = 1.642
- SVP Gaussian / both / c = 1.987

The actual constants are always read from
`../power_gaussian/gaussian_mode_calibration.csv`. The benchmark varies the
sequence length under no change and the number of true changes at fixed
`n = 10000`. It uses `ts_generator()`, presents the same generated series to
all methods, randomizes their execution order, performs untimed warmups, and
adaptively batches fast calls to reduce timer-resolution error.

Run from the package root:

```r
Sys.setenv(SVP_RUN_SIMULATIONS = "false")
source("simulations/time_gaussian/run_time.R")
run_and_save_time_gaussian()
```

Raw per-call timings, median summaries, and bootstrap intervals are saved in
this folder. `gaussian_time_slopes.csv` reports descriptive log--log slopes
for the complete size grid and its upper half; they are empirical summaries,
not worst-case complexity proofs. The paper-ready panels are copied to
`../SVP_NEW_Figures2/`.

Earlier implementations and timing results are retained under
`simulations/other_simus/time_gaussian_legacy/` for audit purposes.
